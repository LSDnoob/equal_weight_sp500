# Equal Weight S&P 500 Screener

The S&P 500 index is the most popular stock index market in the world. The S&P 500 is market capitalization-weighted.
This poject focuses on building an alternative version of the S&P 500 index fund that assigns the same way to each company.

There are 3 files attached - the S&P 500 stocks index list as a .csv file, the project .ipynb file and an output .xlsx file which contains the number of shares to buy for a $10,000,000 portfolio value (in an equal - weighted manner, which is the purpose of the project)
